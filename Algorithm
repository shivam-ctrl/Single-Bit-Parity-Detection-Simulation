Step 1 : Take input of a number and convert it into binary.

Step 2 : Check the number of 1’s in the binary number, if it even set parity bit as 0 and if odd then set parity bit as 1, 
         so ultimately the total parity becomes even.
         
Step 3 : For simulating an error, select a random position and a random bit 0/1, 
         then place the bit in the random position.
         
Step 4 : Now again check the number of 1’s in the binary number, 
         if it even set parity bit as 0 and if odd then set parity bit as 1.
         
Step 5 : If the parity bit is 1, then there is an error and so reject the number and 
         if the parity bit is 0, then accept the bits and remove the last two bits from the binary and 
         convert it into decimal, this was our original number.
